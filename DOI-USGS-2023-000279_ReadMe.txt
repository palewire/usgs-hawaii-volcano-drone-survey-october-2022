INTRODUCTION

This folder contains records pursuant to FOIA request # DOI-USGS-2023-000279 from Mr. Ben Walsh of MuckRock News, seeking the digital elevation models (DEMs) constructed from the USGS-Hawaiian Volcano Observatory's October 2022 Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) mission at Halema'uma'u crater, Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. One DEM was constructed from the mission on October 5, 2022, with 1-meter spatial resolution.


CONTENTS

This folder contains a GeoTIFF-format DEM titled KIL_HMM_20221005_DEM1m.tif that was constructed from the mission on October 5, 2022, with 1-meter spatial resolution.


POSITIONAL ACCURACY

This DEM has been horizontally and vertically aligned to a 2019 airborne LiDAR DEM (Mosbrucker and others, 2020). Although no formal accuracy tests have been completed, the authors have sought to achieve horizontal accuracies of 5 meters or less and vertical accuracies of 2 meters or less.

DISCLAIMERS

USGS has special use permits from the National Park Service to conduct official UAS missions as part of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory's mission to monitor active volcanoes in Hawaii, assess their hazards, issue warnings, and advance scientific understanding to reduce impacts of volcanic eruptions. Launching, landing, or operating an unmanned aircraft from or on lands and waters administered by the National Park Service within the boundaries of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park is prohibited under 36 CFR Closures & Public Use.

This digital dataset should not be used in any manner that violates the spatial accuracy of approximately 5 meters horizontally and 2 meters vertically. Although digital geospatial data are not constrained by scale like paper maps, the inherent uncertainty of the source data is transferred to this dataset.
